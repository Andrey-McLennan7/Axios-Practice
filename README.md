# Axios Practice

## Overview
This project is a simple web application built to practice making HTTP requests using **Axios** and rendering API data on the client.  
It demonstrates essential skills for modern web development, including asynchronous JavaScript, API integration, error handling, and dynamic UI updates.

## Features
- Fetches data from an external API using Axios  
- Renders results dynamically in the UI  
- Handles errors gracefully (e.g., failed requests)  
- Clean, simple layout with EJS templates and custom CSS  
- Modular structure that makes it easy to add new endpoints or features

## Tech Stack
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Axios**
- **EJS**
- **CSS**
- **Node.js**

## 📝 Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Andrey-McLennan7/Axios-Practice.git
cd Axios-Practice
npm install
node insdex.js  # or nodemon index.js if you have the nodemon package installed
```

Then open your browser at: http://localhost:3000

## Usage
Once the server is running, the app will perform a request to the configured API endpoint and display the returned data on the page.

Typical interactions include:
- Triggering a new Axios request
- Viewing the rendered response
- Seeing error messages if something goes wrong

## What I Learned / What I Implemented
This project helped me deepen my understanding of:
- Making GET requests using Axios
- Working with async/await and Promises
- Using EJS templates to render dynamic content
- Updating the UI based on API data
- Implementing basic error handling

Additional contributions:
- Custom styling
- Improved file organization
- Cleaner, more readable code

## Future Improvements
Potential upgrades for the project:
- Add loading states (spinners, skeletons)
- Support more API endpoints
- Add environment variable support for API keys
- Expand UI functionality
- Add tests (unit/integration)
